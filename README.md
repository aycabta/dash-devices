# DashDevices

- Security Profile ID (as an Application ID) for Login with Amazon relates just one account for Dash Replenishment Service
- Device Model relates just one Application ID
- So, Device Model from another user can not be used for my Application ID
- I must develop Device Model creation page for this product...
